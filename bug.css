The CSS property `calc()` is used incorrectly, resulting in unexpected layout or rendering issues.  For example, using `calc(100% - 10px)` within a flexbox context might not produce the expected result if the parent element doesn't have a defined width.  Another example is misusing units within `calc()`, leading to parsing errors.  Finally, nesting `calc()` expressions excessively can lead to decreased performance and readability.
